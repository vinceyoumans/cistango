# Code Challenge
one of the HOWTO's for using Pointers for codesausage.com

## assignment one

### Write a golang app using goroutine and channels to send numbers sequentially from 1 to 10 and print.
Demonstrate a couple of ways to do this.

#### ass01 
An unbuffered channel. 

#### ass02
Version 2, using GoRoutines, but Not using Channels. Instead, I am using waitgroups.  

#### ass03
Demonstrating multiple channels and a SELECT statement.  The results are completely random.

*TODO*   mutex example...


#### ass04
Version 4
A goRoutine example, but uses Pointers to pass parameters by reference.
I also include a main_test.go

``` run test ```
part of the test fails intentionally


## assignment 

### Write a go code to create a struct type with 3 fields date, time and zone and print the values in a json format.

Aspects of the GoLang Demonstration.
1. struct
2. Slice
3. time package

###  TODO
1. I will be adding some Docker and Docker-Compose examples to the above.
2. Add Unit testing
